    <h1>Sudan: A Land Rich in Gold, Yet Thirsting for Water</h1>

 <section class="content">

    <p>Sudan, a country rich in gold, faces a severe water shortage that deeply affects its economy, society, and daily lifeâ€”especially amidst a war that has dragged on for over a year.</p>

    <p>In the first quarter of this year alone, Sudan exported over 7.626 tons of gold, valued at $428 million. Projections suggest that by the end of the year, gold exports could reach $2.182 billion. Despite this wealth, millions are struggling to find a basic necessity: clean water.</p>

    <p>In the displacement camp of <strong>Sortony</strong> in North Darfur, home to over 65,000 people, Issa, a father of several children, shares his daily struggle:</p>

    <blockquote>"Since the start of the war in April 2023, two of my children walk 14 kilometers each day just to fetch water."</blockquote>

    <p>Darfur, a vast region scarred by conflict, hosts the majority of Sudanâ€™s displaced people. The ongoing shortage of water only adds to the daily hardships faced by millions.</p>

    <p>Sudanâ€™s fragile infrastructureâ€”damaged by decades of conflictâ€”combined with the devastating effects of climate change, creates a perfect storm. Torrential rains are often followed by extreme heatwaves, with summer temperatures soaring close to 50 degrees Celsius (122 degrees Fahrenheit).</p>

    <p>When the latest war erupted between the Sudanese army, led by Abdel Fattah al-Burhan, and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), led by Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo (Hemedti), humanitarian workers fled the country. This exodus dramatically reduced aid to vulnerable communities.</p>

    <p>Issa explains that an Italian humanitarian organization previously responsible for maintaining clean water stations in Sortony had to abandon their efforts due to the conflict.</p>

    <p>Even before the war, the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) warned that 26% of Sudanese had to walk over 50 minutes to access clean water, exposing especially women to significant security risks.</p>

    <p>In the village of <strong>Shaqra</strong> in Darfur, which shelters around 40,000 displaced individuals, residents queue for hours under the burning sun, waiting their turn at the scarce water sources. Lines can stretch over 300 meters.</p>

    <p>Outside of regions near rivers like the Nile, Sudan depends primarily on two water sources: seasonal rains and groundwater. However, since 2020, East Africaâ€”including Sudanâ€”has suffered its worst drought in 40 years. Five consecutive failed rainy seasons have wiped out millions of livestock, devastated crops, and forced millions to flee their homes.</p>

    <p>Accessing groundwater is no easier. Due to severe fuel shortages caused by the war, many wells cannot be operated, especially in remote areas like Darfur and Gedaref.</p>

    <blockquote>"Even if water is available underground, without fuel or a functioning pump, itâ€™s out of reach," said a European diplomat familiar with the situation.</blockquote>

    <p>He added that water often lies more than 60 meters deep, making manual pumping virtually impossible.</p>

    <p>The humanitarian situation is especially dire in <strong>El Fasher</strong>, the capital of North Darfur State, home to 1.5 million people. Since May, heavy fighting has isolated the city, creating severe shortages of food and drinking water.</p>
