    <h1>Sudanâ€™s Silent Catastrophe: Famine Spreads as War Rages On</h1>

    <img src="sudan-famine-crisis.webp" alt="Famine in Sudan - Malnourished children and conflict" class="hero-image">
    
    <main>
      <section class="content">
        <p>"I know the smell of war, the image of war, and the sound of war," said Dr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization, in an interview with the BBC's Today program following his recent visit to Sudan. He warned that famine in the war-torn country is now "almost everywhere."</p>
    
        <p>During his visit, Dr. Ghebreyesus toured an internally displaced persons (IDP) camp and a hospital. "You see many emaciated children there," he said, highlighting that nearly 25 million peopleâ€”half the countryâ€™s populationâ€”are in urgent need of support.</p>
    
        <p>He emphasized that around 12 million Sudanese have already been displaced. Dr. Ghebreyesus also criticized the global response, calling it "really weak" and suggesting that race plays a role in the lack of attention Sudan receives.</p>
    
        <blockquote>"Sudan is not getting the attention it deserves," he said. "After Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, the world didnâ€™t show equal concern for Black lives as it did for white lives."</blockquote>
    
        <p>His warning is just the latest in a series of alerts about widespread famine in Sudan. In August 2024, a UN-backed panel declared famine conditions at a camp near the besieged city of El Fasher in Darfur, home to around 500,000 displaced people.</p>
    
        <p>On September 12, Cindy McCain, Executive Director of the World Food Programme (WFP), told the Associated Press that the agency needs better access to those at risk of starvation and more funding from crisis-fatigued Western donors. She warned that "Sudan has become an almost forgotten crisis."</p>
    
        <p>McCain noted that WFP had identified access routes to reach the hungry, but the rainy season hindered truck deliveries to camps like Zamzam, which crossed famine thresholds as early as February.</p>
    
        <blockquote>"It took our trucks nearly two weeks to get there," McCain said. "Bridges were flooded. Roads were impassable. Itâ€™s a truly tragic situation."</blockquote>
    
        <p>She stressed, "We need large-scale access, and the world must understand the urgency and whatâ€™s at stake if we donâ€™t act."</p>
    
        <h2>The War Is the Root Cause</h2>
    
        <p>Numerous international reports confirm that the ongoing war between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces (RSF)â€”which began in April 2023â€”is the main driver of what is now one of the worldâ€™s worst famines, particularly in Darfur, a region once known as the "breadbasket of the world."</p>
    
        <p>Both warring parties face accusations of using starvation as a weapon. In an interview with The Guardian, U.S. Special Envoy Tom Perriello described both sides as "cowardly" for employing such tactics.</p>
    
        <blockquote>"Itâ€™s shocking to witness the lack of courage and honor," said Perriello, "especially when they prefer to use starving women and children as leverage rather than fighting militarily."</blockquote>
    
        <p>Despite these dire conditions, Sudanese authorities continue to deny the existence of famine. In August, the Humanitarian Aid Commission dismissed reports of famine in Zamzam camp in North Darfur, arguing the conditions didnâ€™t meet official famine declaration criteria.</p>
    
        <p>Similarly, in March, Sudanâ€™s Minister of Agriculture, Abubakr Omer El-Bushra, denied any famine, challenging those claiming otherwise to present concrete evidence. He stated that famines result from drought and pests and insisted that Sudan's 2024 grain production of 7.3 million tons was sufficient for 48 million people.</p>
    
        <h2>Questions the World Must Ask</h2>
    
        <ul>
          <li>Can the looming famine in Sudan be stopped?</li>
          <li>Why do both warring parties seem indifferent to famine warnings?</li>
          <li>How credible is the Sudanese governmentâ€™s denial of famine?</li>
          <li>Should we trust international organizationsâ€™ alerts or official Sudanese statements?</li>
          <li>Is saving people from famine and displacement possible without ending the war?</li>
          <li>What can the global community do to help while the war continues?</li>
        </ul>
